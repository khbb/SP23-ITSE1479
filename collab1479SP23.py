#
#Please enter grades you would like to have averaged.
#
#Enter grades(0-100) one at a time (hit enter to submit). Enter "Q"  when you have entered all grades you wish to enter.56
#A(n) 56 is a(n) F.
#Please enter a grade between zero and 100. Type "Q" when you have entered all grades.89
#A(n) 89 is a(n) B.
#Please enter a grade between zero and 100. Type "Q" when you have entered all grades.78
#A(n) 78 is a(n) C.
#Please enter a grade between zero and 100. Type "Q" when you have entered all grades.Q
